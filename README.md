# High-Voltage-HV-Accumulator-Indicator-
The accumulator indicator shows the presence of high voltage on the electric vehicle traction battery up to 250 VDC. A 12 V LED is powered directly from the HV line through a linear regulator based voltage reduction circuit. The design does not rely on the low voltage system and complies with FSAE safety rules.
